**Pre-Experiment**

   1. What may happen if we add excess of HCl to Fe(OH)3 solution?

   2. What is the role of FeCl3 electrolyte in the Fe(OH)3 sol formation via peptization method?

   3. Can you prepare a sol of FeCl3 in water?

   4. Does the peptization method of sol preparation fall under ‘top-down’ or ‘bottom-up’ method?

**Post-Experiment**

   1. Name the method(s) by which you prepared Fe(OH)3 sol.

   2. What are the building blocks of Fe(OH)3 sol?

   3. Why do the colors of the two colloidal dispersions prepared by the two different methods differ?

   4. What may be the roles of higher temperature that is maintained during the colloid preparation?
