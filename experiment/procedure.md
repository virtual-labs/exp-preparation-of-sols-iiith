**To start the experiment do the following:**

  1. Prepare about 20 mL of a concentrated FeCl3.6H2O solution (by dissolving it in about three times its volume of deionized water).

  2.  Take a 1 L conical flask (by clicking on it) and pour about 500 mL of deionized water in the flask.

  3.  Place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer-cum-heater.

  4.  Set the heater temperature to 100Â°C (by clicking on the Heater knob).

  5.  Place a magnetic bar into the flask and set the stirrer to a medium speed.

  6.  When the water in the flask starts boiling, turn off the heater.

  7.  Use a dropper to add some of the original concentrated FeCl3.6H2O solution to the hot water, a few drops at a time. Note down your observation. Then one has to switch off the stirrer.

  8. Take rest of the solution in the beaker and apply heat on it until it boils. Note down your observation.

  9.  Add a few mL of FeCl3.6H2O solution to the above beaker and stir it. Note down your observation.

  10. Filter the solutions first using filter paper and then cellophane. Note down your observation.
